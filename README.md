## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt SASS! Or rather SCSS. This is my first attempt at styling a website using this superset of CSS. I cannot say it's been difficult, since it's pretty similar to CSS, but I admit that I still need to improve the way I use `@mixin`s, especially for responsive purposes. I have seen a few ways of doing this, with and without *media queries*, and I ended up using a mixture.  

### Continued development

I still feel that my (S)CSS code is not very clean, and this is probably because of lack of design planning. I am thinking of just looking at the design and drafting on a piece of paper what the structure and different measures will be in my implementation. I keep looking at Figma to measure every single distance or measure on the go, and I always end up with a mingle of paddings, margins and very specific rems to make the design as *pixel perfect* as I can make it. I am not sure how people do it, but I am sure it will help me clear some code.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A classic. I end up coming back to this on almost every project.
- [FreeCodeCamp SASS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=4520s) - Obviously learning Sass has been a big part of this project. This is the video with which I started and although I haven't finished, it explais very clearly the main features.
- [Brad Traversy SASS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM) - Some reinforcement from the previous video. More straight, mostly focused on applying Sass.
- [Geeks For Geeks How to Load Font Awesome Using SCSS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-load-font-awesome-using-scss/) - It might seem too easy for many, but I did have troubles managing Font Awesome with SCSS. I didn't find the official documentation useful and this link offered the help I needed.
